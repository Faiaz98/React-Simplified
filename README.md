What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It makes creating interactive UIs painless by efficiently updating and rendering the right components when your data changes.

### Why Use React?

- Declarative: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs.
- Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- Learn Once, Write Anywhere: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
